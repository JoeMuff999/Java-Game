parent-child relaionship in Game objects -> this will resolve camera issues
    GO hierarchy
physics components references to each other
main loop -> game programming book 
collisions
scene manager
    serialized scene storage (json?) 
    gameobject hierarchy 
    UI to create scenes 

purpose of this project:
    1. learn more about game programming paradigms (because its fun and satisfying)
    2. make a game
realistically, if I really wanted to make a game quickly, I would just do it in Unity (and i probably will ;) ) 

october 15 - decoupled physics from controllers. made an AddForce method in PhysicsComponent for communicating with physics. 
Used a queue for forces -> eventually can make this concurrent if we keep physics on a separate thread (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Queue.html)

game stuff:
